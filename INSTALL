Basic Installation
==================

        KDE uses the cmake build system. The simple instructions for
building kopete-qq are these commands (starting in kopete source directory):

                        mkdir build && cd build
                        cmake ..
                        make
                        sudo make install

        This will not work unless necessary prerequisites are met. These are,
in the order in which they should be built:

                        kopete
						kdesupport
                        kdelibs
                        kdepimlibs
                        kdebase/runtime
						libev
						sqlite
						js185
